**I will stop using my old email, built by [Tencent ExMail](https://exmail.qq.com/), whose availability cannot meet my requirement. Just now, I was suddenly ENFORCED to bind my ExMail account with WeChat Account so that I can only login by scanning QR code, otherwise I CANNOT send out any emails. I'm not satisfied, but, OK, I did. Then I found the QR code cannot be loaded correctly (see the figure below), so I cannot even login. I cannot get any useful technical support from Tencent ExMail, and I cannot fand any way to report urgent accidents like this. What I can only get is just a useless response from a robot, and hope that it could recover soon.  --0:05am, Dec 4, 2019.**
